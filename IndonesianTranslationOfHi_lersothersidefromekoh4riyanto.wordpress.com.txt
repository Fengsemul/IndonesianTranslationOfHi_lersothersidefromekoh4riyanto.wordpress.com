Due to his fascination with Islamic Civilization, he had printed manuals on Islam and distributed them to Nazi soldiers during the war, even to non-Muslim soldiers.
What you are reading below is a translation of a Malaysian-language email from the ikasmanca@yahoogroups mailing list:
My respect for this great man, Adolf Hitler, I hope someone will follow in his footsteps today.
I chatted with my brother who was finishing his PhD thesis. I was very surprised when he stated his thesis about Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazis. Then I asked, "Are there no Islamic figures in this world until you choose this idiot as the theme of your thesis?"
He laughed then asked what I knew about Hitler.
I replied that Hitler was a murderer who killed everything and considered the German nation above all other nations. Then he asked me where my sources were. From the TV of course, I answered. Then I said that Hitler He also gave the German Muslim soldiers the opportunity to pray whenever it was time anywhere...even German soldiers had prayed in Berlin Square and Hitler waited until they finished the congregational prayers to deliver his speech.

Hitler also often met with the Ulama and asked for their opinion and learned from them about religion and the stories of his friends in formulating strategies...

God bless you.
He also asked the Sheikhs to accompany his soldiers and pray for non-Muslims and encourage the Muslim soldiers to fight against the Jews...

All this data is the result of historical research done by my brother for his PhD thesis and he asked me not to add anything so as not to trouble him when he displays it later. He forbade me to combine this research with data from the internet because I am not an expert in history. But the pictures here have been around for a long time and everyone can see them on the internet.
However, I still looked for additional data from the internet and found some interesting things:
1) The influence of the Quran in Hitler's speech.
When the Nazi army arrived in Moscow, Hitler intended to deliver a speech. He ordered his advisors to find the grand opening words http://ekoh4riyanto.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/sis-lain-hitter-yang-jarang-diungpak

from the scriptures, the words of philosophers or from verses. An Iraqi writer who dated in Germany gave input to a verse from the Qur'an which means: The Day of Judgment is near and the moon has split...
Hitler was impressed by this sentence and used it as the opening sentence and content of his speech. Indeed, the interpretation experts explain that the verse means majesty, strength and deep meaning. This is stated by Hitler in his book Mein Kampf, which was written in prison, that all his actions were based on the Quran, especially his actions against the Jews.
2) Hitler swore in the name of God Almighty
Hitler has included an oath in the name of God Almighty in the oath of his army leaders who will finish studying at the German Army Academy.
*I swear in the name of Allah (God) the Most Great and this is my holy oath, that I will obey all orders of the leadership of the German army and its leader Adolf Hitler, the supreme commander, that I will always be ready to sacrifice my life at any time for the sake of my leader"
3) Hitler abstained from drinking alcohol as he trembled when the situation of the German army was shaky and dangerous. At that time the doctors asked him to drink alcohol as a medicine and he refused saying, "How do you want to tell someone to drink alcohol for treatment when he has never touched alcohol in his whole life?"
Yes, Hitler did not touch alcohol all his life... his favorite drink was special dipping tea...
The purpose of this writing is not to defend what Hitler has done, but only aims to reveal what is hidden by the West. May we all benefit.
